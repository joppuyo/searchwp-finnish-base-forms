# SearchWP Finnish Base Forms

[![Latest Stable Version](https://poser.pugx.org/joppuyo/searchwp-finnish-base-forms/v/stable)](https://packagist.org/packages/joppuyo/searchwp-finnish-base-forms) [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/joppuyo/searchwp-finnish-base-forms.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/joppuyo/searchwp-finnish-base-forms)

SearchWP plugin to add Finnish base forms into search index using [Voikko](https://voikko.puimula.org/).

## What does it do?

This plugin allows you to add base forms of Finnish words in SearchWP search index. For example for word *koirillekin*, tokens *koirillekin* and *koira* are saved in the index during indexing. Learn mode by reading [this article](https://www.creuna.com/fi/ajankohtaista/wordpress-haku-searchwp-voikko/) (in Finnish).

This plugin is compatible with Polylang. If you have Polylang installed, it will only process content written in Finnish.

## Options

### API type

You can use bundled **voikkospell binary** (on a linux x64 system) to lemmatize the indexed terms.

There is also an option to use a system-wide **voikkospell command line application** if you have Voikko installed on your system.

It's also possible to set up an external **Node.js API** to access Voikko over HTTP. Using the binary or CLI application is much faster because it doesn't have the overhead of performing a HTTP request.

Special thanks to [siiptuo](https://github.com/siiptuo) for contributing voikkospell support for this plugin!

### Add base forms to search query

Enable this option to add base forms to search queries entered by users.

### Split compound words

Enable this option to split compound words during indexing (and for user queries if the above option is enabled). For example, the word *kerrostaloille* is transformed into tokens *kerrostaloille*,  *kerrostalo*, *kerros* and *talo* in the search index.
