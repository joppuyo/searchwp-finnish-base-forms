# SearchWP Finnish Base Forms

SearchWP plugin to add Finnish base forms into search index using [Voikko](https://voikko.puimula.org/).

You can either use **Node.js application** to access Voikko over HTTP or use a locally installed **voikkospell command line application** to lemmatize the indexed terms. Special thanks to [siiptuo](https://github.com/siiptuo) for contributing voikkospell support for this plugin!

The CLI application is much faster because it doesn't have the overhead of performing a HTTP request.
